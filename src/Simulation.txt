In UNDER_TEST mode, meant to be run in a PC, hardware is
simulated as follows:

1) File gpio.txt is read as an integer number. Bits 0-5 are
   level sensors, bits 6 and 7 are the manual switches.

2) Flow meter pulses are simulated by signalling the process
   using SIGUSR1, which is easier to do rhythmically by a
   flow meter simulator.

3) Pump output bit is simulated by writing to gpio2.txt.
